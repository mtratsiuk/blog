# The One Where I Went to The Enter Shikari Concert for the 6th Time

My cousin introduced me to [Enter Shikari](https://www.entershikari.com/)'s music probably somewhere around 2008. In 2013 we went to see them live in Minsk for the first time - was both an amazing concert and a road trip experience. I went to see them play multiple times since then - in Belarus, UK and Netherlands - and was never disappointed. Old songs hit hard, and new albums slowly grow on you after hearing them live.

## Technical Bit

As it happens with self-written tools, I had to [push](https://github.com/mtratsiuk/b3/commit/c018e03ea82be5814f8827a5202f2a9f076f01c1) a little update to [b3](https://github.com/mtratsiuk/b3) again in order to add `<video>` support.
